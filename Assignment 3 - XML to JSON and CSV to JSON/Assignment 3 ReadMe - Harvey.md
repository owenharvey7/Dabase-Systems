- I set both of my files to run with Python. 
- To ensure these run correctly having python and the libraries used installed is essential. 
- For both there are two functions where you specify the name of your csv or xml file. These two functions are the main functions. 
- For the csv_to_json and xml_to_json functions the outlines of the tweets are specified to get the correct specifications for the JSON to be in the proper format. 
- Validation can be checked using the formatdata program.
